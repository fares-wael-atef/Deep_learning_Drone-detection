# Deep_learning_Drone-detection
This repository implements drone detection using pretrained CNN models: VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet (ResNet50, ResNet101, ResNet152). By leveraging transfer learning, the project fine-tunes these architectures for drone detection tasks and compares their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and inference time.
